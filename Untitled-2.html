    This is my disgusting son, Camazotz
He is a cat, he has the IQ of a sewer rat, and he has an obsession with pipe cleaners. He is also super loving and kind, and enjoys falling asleep on warm things (including people). He cries if I leave him alone for two minutes, and he is pretty fond of being held.

    He is my only remaining friend. I just sneezed and woke Camazotz up, I am so sorry. I am unforgivable.

Okay, I tucked him in nice and cozy. I think I am forgiven.

This is where the fun stuff ends, before I recount to you my entire history of trauma, because I have an over sharing problem. Seemed like a nice aside.

    document.write('A few months back, this girl started hanging out with my friend group. Back when I, y’know. Had friends. She was a strange one from the moment we met. She said she made her money from Twitch streaming, and she dressed like she actually cared about how she was perceived. Her outfits were complex, modern, and generally sort of goth. Now, based on this description thus far, it might sound like I had a crush on her. Not at all. Because I saw her personality soon. She told the friend group that she knew many different Minecraft YouTubers. Dream, Ranboo, the like. Even typing their names now makes me sick. My best friend, at the time, started dating her within about a week of knowing her. My partner at the time was really into those Minecraft streamers, and was willing to do just about anything for them. The girl was living in my partners home by the end of the month. Not occasionally crashing there. Living there. She said that she was from an abusive home, and that she was kicked out of her mothers place. Cue my partner, swooping in, and deciding to take her in. (Yeah, someone even dated me. Quite a fall from grace, eh?) Over time, they became… worryingly close. Not even in a cheating way, but in a way where it was impossible to communicate with my partner without her knowing the entire conversation. And I was starting to see some holes. I never saw any real evidence that linked her and the YouTubers, so I told my partner. I thought everything was fine, but maybe a few minutes later, she texts me, or a group chat or something, saying that I think she’s a liar. Which was fair enough, but really not something I would have told her myself. We still got on well enough. For a while, at least. I’m not going to lie, I pretty much never do, I was interested in these YouTubers, and some glimpse of fame. It’s always been my dream to be a famous musician, and it would’ve been a huge jump start. But I digress. One day, the girl, and my partner leave for Victoria on a trip. I was fine with this. What I was not fine with, was how she (allegedly) took them both to England, without so much as telling me. She said she flew my partner all the way out there, while deliberately trying to keep it from me. But I say allegedly because, according to my partners mother, their passport was not with them. Not even printed, really. Never went out of the country, so, never had a need. Now, my partner, in retrospect, was unbelievably shitty. They said they had the hots for Ranboo. Who, according to the girl, was going to be there, in England. This girl flew my partner out to someone they said they wanted to fuck. That isn’t hyperbole. When I said that that made me hideously uncomfortable, she tried to spin it into an issue of me not trusting my partner. She started to make routine “jokes” about my partner cheating on me. I’m unearthing everything as I write, and even now, months later, they make me wanna hurl. And they did. Often. I went through many bouts of being entirely unable to eat for a day. Every time a piece of food entered my mouth, my guts started to churn. She also said that Wilbur Soot was especially close with her. In a way that I swear to god, might as well have been ripped off of Wattpad. She said he bought her outfits. BDSM outfits. She said she once gave him an erection that lasted an entire stream. She said that his then girlfriend found out about them, and killed his cat. None of this has any real world evidence outside of the outfit, which she could have bought herself. In fact, from what I can find, the dead cat was just a metaphor in a lyric in one of his songs. But I had the audacity to say that that was some paedophile shit. Specifically, I said it when she was saying she was going to kill herself. Already, after every way that she had hurt me, and hurt me more than I could even imagine, I still wasn’t going to let her die. So, I told her to slap me over the paedophile comment. Got her to Monday, and she left me with a mild corneal abrasion. My partner wasn’t there when she slapped me, my best friend of the time was, and he was fuckin’ pissed about that fact. He tracked down my partner to try and explain how uncomfortable it was to watch his best friend get slapped. My partner just went home for the day. With the girl, too. My partner was really not the type to deal with conflict. More of "a run away until it fixes itself" type of deal. Some time after all that is when I started to harm myself. Started out mild, got much worse, usual story. I think I started taking escitalopram around this time, too. Pretty standard antidepressant deal. Eventually, through the harm, inability to eat, and intense feelings of illness due to the aforementioned reasons, my family decided I was really in no shape to attend school in person. Over time, my former friends decided to stay with the girl, and abandon me. I finished up the year, and got a part time job. Seeing psychiatrists, doing my best, it’s been a long, long conflict. And, as you might guess, I haven’t really been having a great time. But then I saw you, and your arm, and something just clicked. You haven’t even had to do anything, but just knowing that you exist gives me some bizarre comfort. I’m such a goddamn dork that I have dreams of us being friends. Sort of like, I don’t know, this entire experience isn’t entirely isolated. That there are people going through the same. And I want to learn all about you. I’ve been so curious about you, and so nervous to say anything. I want to know your favourite hobbies, bands, candies, benign shit that sews life together with colourful thread. I know the prevalent question is still going to be “Why me?” But honestly, now, you know as much as I do. I think my luck’s starting to turn around? I heard that the girl finally broke everyone else’s patience, or something or other. So, might as well try my luck here as well. I don’t want to be so alone, anymore. I think I’m worth a try. I hope. It’s too quiet. I don’t like it how I used to. If I’ve interested you enough, or you just have any questions, I’m below. Don’t worry about bothering me. Please.
